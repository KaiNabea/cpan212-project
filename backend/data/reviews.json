        "film": "Yes Man",
        "rating": 6,
        "review": "A breezy comedy where the word yes starts off as a curse before slowly morphing into a blessing in disguise. While one will have fun with this, it's hard to feel like the message of the movie, \"don't be afraid to take risks\", is undercut by the film itself playing it a little safe."
